# fetch_tray

A library to abstract and help with HTTP API requests.
Strictly typed, flexible and fully testable.

It also includes simple `flutter_hooks` support.

## Overview

This libraries goal is to abstract every REST endpoint into it's own `TrayRequest` class, that defines all the basic information, so it can just be used by calling `makeTrayRequest` with the specific endpoint TrayRequest class combined with the needed `params`, `headers` and `body` parameters.
